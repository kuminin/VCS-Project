### Introduction
This is the first part of our VCS (Version Control System) project. It only implements an initial use- case: Create Repo. It also makes a number of simplifying assumptions in order to get to working S/W quickly.

### External Requirements:
None

### Build, Installation, and Setup.
Copy the backend.py into the desired project location. Uncomment line 103 from the backend.py and the run the script by typing python backend.py in to the command line.

To test the program run the script unitTest.py to test the minimal ptree and tiny ptree with files inputs.

### Usage
```
mkdir ~/Desktop/testFile && ~/Desktop/testFile/mypt
cat > ~/Desktop/testFile/mypt/h.txt
H
Press ctrl-d
cp backend.py ~/Desktop/testFile
cd ~/Desktop/testFile
python backend.py
```

### Extra Features
Unit Testing for sample input

### Bugs
We are not sure if the script will run on Windows OS.
